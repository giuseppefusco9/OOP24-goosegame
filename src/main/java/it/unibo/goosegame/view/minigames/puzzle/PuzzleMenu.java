            The Puzzle game consists of a 5x5 grid of tiles displaying an image, 
            which gets shuffled when you press the Start button (located at the bottom right).
            The goal is to rearrange the image within 2 minutes and 30 seconds (the time is shown at the bottom left).

            To play, select two tiles: they will be swapped.
            Keep going until the image is correctly reassembled.

            The game ends when:
            --> You successfully complete the puzzle (You Win!)
            --> Time runs out before you finish (You Lose!)

            Remember:
            --> Take time to memorize the image before it gets shuffled.
            --> Think ahead to minimize your moves.
            --> The clock is ticking â€” stay focused!
